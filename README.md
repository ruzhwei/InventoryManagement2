# InventoryManagement

This is for shopify technical challenge.

CRUD and warehouses are implemented.

It can be run direcltly on Replit, just hit run button.

In case it cannot be triggered by the button directly, we can fork this repl, then in the console:

Install flask_sqlalchemy first with command:

pip install flask_sqlalchemy

Then run app.py by this command:

python app.py

By now, the web page should appear in replit.
